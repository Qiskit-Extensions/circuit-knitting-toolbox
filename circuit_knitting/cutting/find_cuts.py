    """Find cut locations in a circuit, given optimization settings and QPU constraints.

    Args:
        circuit: The circuit to cut. The circuit must contain only single two-qubit
            gates.
        optimization: Options for controlling optimizer behavior. Currently, the optimal
            cuts are arrived at using Dijkstra's best-first search algorithm. The specified
            parameters are:

            - max_gamma: Specifies a constraint on the maximum value of gamma that a
              solution to the optimization is allowed to have to be considered
              feasible. Note that the sampling overhead is ``gamma ** 2``.
            - max_backjumps: Specifies a constraint on the maximum number of backjump
              operations that can be performed by the search algorithm.
            - seed: A seed for the pseudorandom number generator used by the optimizer.

        constraints: Options for specifying the constraints for circuit cutting:
            - qubits_per_subcircuit: The maximum number of qubits per subcircuit.
    Returns:
        A circuit containing :class:`.BaseQPDGate` instances. The subcircuits
        resulting from cutting these gates will be runnable on the devices
        specified in ``constraints``.

        A metadata dictionary:
            - cuts: A list of length-2 tuples describing each cut in the output circuit.
              The tuples are formatted as ``(cut_type: str, cut_id: int)``. The
              cut ID is the index of the cut gate or wire in the output circuit's
              ``data`` field.
            - sampling_overhead: The sampling overhead incurred from cutting the specified
              gates and wires.

    Raises:
        ValueError: The input circuit contains a gate acting on more than 2 qubits.
