class DisjointSubcircuitsState:

    """Class for representing search-space states when cutting
    circuits to construct disjoint subcircuits.  Only minimally
    sufficient information is stored in order to minimize the
    memory footprint.

    Each wire cut introduces a new wire.  A mapping from qubit IDs
    in QASM-like statements to wire IDs is therefore created
    and maintained.  Groups of wires form subcircuits, and these
    subcircuits can then be merged via search actions.  The mapping
    from wires to subcircuits is represented using an up-tree data
    structure over wires.  The number of wires (width) in each
    subcircuit is also tracked to ensure subcircuits will fit on
    target quantum devices.

    Member Variables:

    wiremap (int Numpy array) provides the mapping from qubit IDs
    to wire IDs.

    num_wires (int) is the number of wires in the cut circuit.

    uptree (int Numpy array) contains the uptree data structure that
    defines groups of wires that form subcircuits.  The uptree array
    map wire IDs to parent wire IDs in a subcircuit.  If a wire points
    to itself, then that wire is the root wire in the corresponding
    subcircuit.  Otherwise, you need to follow the parent links to find
    the root wire that corresponds to that subcircuit.

    width (int Numpy array) contains the number of wires in each
    subcircuit.  The values of width are valid only for root wire IDs.

    bell_pairs (list) is a list of pairs of subcircuits (wires) that
    define the virtual Bell pairs that would need to be constructed in
    order to implement optimal LOCC cuts using ancillas.

    gamma_LB (float) is the cumulative lower-bound gamma for circuit cuts
    that cannot be constructed using Bell pairs, such as LO gate cuts
    for small-angled rotations.

    gamma_UB (float) is the cumulative upper-bound gamma for all circuit
    cuts assuming all cuts are LO.

    no_merge (list) contains a list of subcircuit merging constaints.
    Each constraint can either be a pair of wire IDs or a list of pairs
    of wire IDs.  In the case of a pair of wire IDs, the constraint is
    that the subcircuits that contain those wire IDs cannot be merged
    by subsequent search actions.  In the case of a list of pairs of
    wire IDs, the constraint is that at least one pair of corresponding
    subcircuits cannot be merged.

    actions (list) contains a list of circuit-cutting actions that have
    been performed on the circuit.  Elements of the list have the form

        [<action_object>, <gate_specification>, (<arg_1>, ..., <arg_n>)]

    The <action_object> is the object that was used to generate the
    circuit cut.  The <gate_specification> is the specification of the
    cut gate using the format defined in the CircuitInterface class
    description.  The trailing entries are the arguments needed by the
    <action_object> to apply further search-space generating objects
    in Stage Two in order to explore the space of QPD assignments to
    the circuit-cutting action.

    level (int) is the level in the search tree at which this search
    state resides, with 0 being the root of the search tree.
