class LOCutsOnlyOptimizer:

    """Wrapper class for optimizing circuit cuts for the case in which
    only LO quasiprobability decompositions are employed.

    The search_engine_config dictionary that configures the optimization
    algorithms must be specified in the constructor.  For flexibility, the
    circuit_interface, optimization_settings, and device_constraints can
    be specified either in the constructor or in the optimize() method. In
    the latter case, the values provided overwrite the previous values.

    The circuit_interface object that is passed to the optimize()
    method is updated to reflect the optimized circuit cuts that were
    identified.

    Member Variables:

    circuit_interface (CircuitInterface) defines the circuit to be cut.

    optimization_settings (OptimizationSettings) defines the settings
    to be used for the optimization.

    device_constraints (DeviceConstraints) defines the capabilties of
    the target quantum hardware.

    search_engine_config (dict) maps names of stages of optimization to
    the corresponding SearchSpaceGenerator functions and actions that
    are used to perform the search for each stage.

    cut_optimization (CutOptimization) is the object created to
    perform the circuit cutting optimization.

    best_result (DisjointSubcircuitsState) is the lowest-cost
    DisjointSubcircuitsState object identified in the search.
