Installation Instructions
#########################

There are two options: installing locally or using within a Docker
container. If you are using macOS or Linux with an Intel chip (i.e., not
the new M1 or M2 chips), everything should work natively, so we
recommend the first option. All users on ARM chips, as well as all
Windows users, will have to use the toolbox within Docker (the second
option) for everything to work as designed.

Option 1: Local installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **OPTIONAL** If a user wishes to use the circuit cutting tool to
   automatically find optimized cut points for a circuits too large for
   the free version of CPLEX, they should acquire a license and install
   the `full
   version <https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjuq9OM1M75AhVoFNQBHWqGBW4YABAAGgJvYQ&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESauD2CglQCoRYTsgQCH50ip7Y_PCiHfnYyojivn_Od4YBaoXY74TyZYrKZNZuL0H9je0pzRNWut7uutUNmRc2x-P0nuTbQLAaC2p2fI3PTD87BbRBI07uzMo0ZTSmkyWQiGb9C3Hkv1bbawk&sig=AOD64_0oLk3SUhEbH-EQ35AWeP5_94a45A&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwiA1MmM1M75AhXXrmoFHdAcCVQQ0Qx6BAgEEAE&nis=2>`__.

-  Enter a Python environment and install the software

.. code:: sh

    $ git clone git@github.com:Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox.git
    $ cd circuit-knitting-toolbox
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    $ pip install tox notebook -e '.[notebook-dependencies]'
    $ jupyter notebook

-  Navigate to the notebooks in the ``docs/`` directory to run the
   tutorials.

Option 2: Use within Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have provided a ```Dockerfile`` <Dockerfile>`__, which can be used to
build a Docker image, as well as a
```docker-compose.yml`` <docker-compose.yml>`__ file, which allows one
to use the Docker image with just a few simple commands. If you have
Docker installed but not `Docker
Compose <https://pypi.org/project/docker-compose/>`__, the latter can be
installed by first running ``pip install docker-compose``.

.. code:: sh

    $ git clone git@github.com:Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox.git
    $ cd circuit-knitting-toolbox
    $ docker-compose build
    $ docker-compose up

Depending on your system configuration, you may need to type ``sudo``
before each ``docker-compose`` command.

Once the container is running, you should see a message like this:

::

    notebook_1  |     To access the server, open this file in a browser:
    notebook_1  |         file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-7-open.html
    notebook_1  |     Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
    notebook_1  |         http://e4a04564eb39:8888/lab?token=00ed70b5342f79f0a970ee9821c271eeffaf760a7dcd36ec
    notebook_1  |      or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=00ed70b5342f79f0a970ee9821c271eeffaf760a7dcd36ec

Locate the *last* URL in your terminal (the one that includes
``127.0.0.1``), and navigate to that URL in a web browser to access the
Jupyter notebook interface.

The home directory includes a subdirectory named ``persistent-volume``.
All work youâ€™d like to save should be placed in this directory, as it is
the only one that will be saved across different container runs.
