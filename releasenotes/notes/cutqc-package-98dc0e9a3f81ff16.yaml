deprecations:
  - |
    The ``circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.wire_cutting`` package
    is deprecated and should be replaced by the
    ``circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.cutqc`` package.

    Both gate and wire cutting will be implemented directly into the
    ``circuit_cutting`` package, and the ``circuit_cutting.cutqc``
    package will remain available for users of the automatic cut
    finding capability and the full probability reconstruction.

    To migrate your workflows, simply replace
    ``from circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.wire_cutting import ...``
    with
    ``from circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.cutqc import ...``
