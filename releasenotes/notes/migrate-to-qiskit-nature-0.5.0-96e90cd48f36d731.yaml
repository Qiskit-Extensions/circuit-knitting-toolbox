features:

    Full support for Qiskit Nature 0.5.0.
upgrade:
  - |
    Support for Qiskit Nature < 0.5.0 has been removed upon this release.

    Users are now be required to use the ``:class:~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureProblem``,
    as input to the entanglement forging, rather than the deprecated ``:class:~qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization.ElectronicStructureProblem``.

    For more information on migrating to Qiskit Nature 0.5.0, check out the
    [Qiskit Nature migration guide](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/migration/00_Migration_Guide_to_v0.5.html).

    For more information on adapting your entanglement forging workflows, check
    out the [tutorials](https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/tree/main/docs/tutorials/entanglement_forging)
    and [how-to's](https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/tree/main/docs/how-tos/entanglement_forging)
    in the ``circuit-knitting-toolbox`` repository.

    The ``:class:~circuit_knitting_toolbox.utils.IntegralDriver`` class is removed. The new Qiskit Nature
    API allows for a more flexible build-up of the ``:class:~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureProblem``,
    and this driver is no longer needed.
