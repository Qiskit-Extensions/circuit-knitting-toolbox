features:
  - |
    Full support for Qiskit Nature 0.5.0.
deprecations:
  - |
    As ``circuit-knitting-toolbox`` is in the alpha development stages, there
    will be no deprecation period on entanglement forging workflows using 
    deprecated Qiskit Nature API calls. Users will now be required to use the
    new classes, such as ``:class:~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureProblem``,
    as inputs to the entanglement forging classes and functions.

    For more information on migrating to Qiskit Nature 0.5.0, check out the
    [Qiskit Nature migration guide](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/migration/00_Migration_Guide_to_v0.5.html).

    For more information on adapting your entanglement forging workflows, check
    out the [tutorials](https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/tree/main/docs/tutorials/entanglement_forging) and [how-to's](https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/tree/main/docs/how-tos/entanglement_forging) in the ``circuit-knitting-toolbox`` repository.

    The ``:class:~circuit_knitting_toolbox.utils.IntegralDriver`` class will be removed, as the new Qiskit Nature
API allows for a more flexible build-up of the ``:class:~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureProblem``,
and this driver is no longer needed.
