    0.2.0 is centered around the addition of functions which allow for the easy
    implementation of gate cutting workflows.

    The foundation of the CKT circuit cutting API is the :mod:`circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd`
    module. This module allows for easy transformation of elements of quantum circuits (gates and wires) into
    elements which probabilistically decompose to a particular set of gates with respect to a given basis. See
    :class:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd.QPDBasis` and
    :class:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd.BaseQPDGate` for more information.

    Additionally, 0.2.0 includes a set of functions which allow for easy implementation
    of gate cutting workflows. These functions are built on top of the QPD package. Like all circuit
    knitting techniques, gate cutting can be described as a decomposition of a problem,
    execution of many subexperiments, and reconstruction of a simulated output of the original circuit.
    These steps are realized in the :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting` module with a few primary
    functions, namely, the `partition_problem`, `decompose_gates`, `execute_experiments`, and `reconstruct_expectation_values`.
    Check out the `tutorials <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/tree/main/docs/circuit_cutting/tutorials>`_ for a look at a couple of circuit cutting workflows.

    Addition of :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd` package which allows for easy
    transformation of elements of quantum circuits (gates and wires) into elements which
    probabilistically decompose to a particular set of gates with respect to a given basis. See 
    :class:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd.QPDBasis` and 
    :class:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd.BaseQPDGate` for more information.

    Addition of :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.cutting_decomposition`, :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.cutting_decomposition`,
    and :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.cutting_decomposition` modules. These modules
    provide several functions which allow for easy implementation of a gate cutting workflow, namely,
    the `partition_problem`, `decompose_gates`, `execute_experiments`, and `reconstruct_expectation_value` functions.
