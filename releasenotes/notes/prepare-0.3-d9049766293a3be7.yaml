  The 0.3.0 release introduces significant new features while maining
  backwards compatibility with the 0.2.0 release.  The most striking
  change in this release is the shortened module names:
  ``circuit_knitting_toolbox`` has been renamed to
  ``circuit_knitting``, ``entanglement_forging`` has been renamed to
  ``forging``, and ``circuit_cutting`` has been renamed to
  ``cutting``.
