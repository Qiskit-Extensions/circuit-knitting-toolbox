    When specifying instances of :class:`OptimizationParameters` that are to be inputted to :func:`find_cuts` the user can now control whether the 
    cut-finder looks only for gate cuts, only for wire cuts, or both, by setting the bools ``gate_lo`` and ``wire_lo`` appropriately. The default value
    of both of these is set to `True` and so the default search considers both gate and wire cuts.
