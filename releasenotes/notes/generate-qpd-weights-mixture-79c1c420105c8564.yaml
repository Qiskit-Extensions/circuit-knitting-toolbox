features:
  - |
    :func:`~circuit_knitting.cutting.qpd.generate_qpd_weights` now
    returns a mixture of exact and sampled weights when appropriate.
    Previously, it would only return exact weights if *all* weights
    were below ``1 / num_samples``; otherwise, all weights were
    sampled.
deprecations:
  - |
    :func:`~circuit_knitting.cutting.qpd.generate_qpd_samples` has
    been renamed to
    :func:`~circuit_knitting.cutting.qpd.generate_qpd_weights`.  The
    original name will be removed no sooner than version 0.4 of the
    Circuit Knitting Toolbox.
